        // Notes about CSV format/escaping:
        // - CSV has a standard, (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) but it is not well respected by producers/consumers in the real world.
        //   The two consumers we care about most are Excel (quick and dirty to look at) and Python pandas.read_csv (for plotting, statistics, etc.).
        // - Strings can be escaped with quotes, a quote inside the string with two doublequotes, e.g., "string with one double quote "" here."
        // - There is no reliable way to encode \r (CR) in a field :(
        //   Excel respects \r\n (CRLF, Windows newline) inside a quoted field, but not \r alone.
        //   So we escape \r and \n with a backslash, even if that breaks round-tripping open and save.
        // - \t before a field prevents Excel from "auto-detecting" the format of the datetime field (which would remove milliseconds).
