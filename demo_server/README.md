Demo Server
===========

This repository contains boilerplate code for a RESTful API based on Flask and Flask-RESTPlus.

Installation
==========================

Downloading Python
------------------
Install python 3.8.2 for your appropriate OS from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Setting up Python environment
-----------------------------
- Get into the server's directory: `cd <path_to_rest.fuzzing>/demo_server`
- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
  - Activate virtual environment (Linux): `source venv/bin/activate`
  - Activate virtual environment (Windows): `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Get dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


Launch Demo Server
==================
Activate virtual environment
----------------------------
Follow instructions above to activate virtual environment

Start demo server at one teminal
--------------------------------
`python demo_server/app.py`

- Make sure you execute all the above from the base directory of demo_server
    (the same directory where this README lives in.)

Swagger
==================
- The interactive swagger specification interface will be available at
    http://localhost:8888/api/ using your browser.
- The swagger can also be found in the demo_server directory as swagger.json
  - The swagger was automatically generated by flask-restplus
- This swagger can be compiled and tested using RESTler.


Start trying the endpoints from the swagger API at your browser and you will
see logs coming in the terminal where the server is running. Moreover, you should
see coverage information produced in demo_server/coverage_stats.txt.

> Ensure your request `Host` header matches the value of `FLASK_SERVER_NAME` in
`settings.py`, else each request will return an HTTP 404.
